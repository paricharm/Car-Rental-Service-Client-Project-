 Got it 👍
Below is a **professional, detailed README.md** written **in the same style and depth** as your *Smart Face Attendance System* README, but adapted for the **Car Rental Service – Client Project**, and **explicitly mentioning that `submit.php` exists but is not included due to confidentiality**.

You can directly copy-paste this into your repo.

## 📖 Contact Form Information

* The **Contact page UI is fully implemented**
* Form validation is handled using **JavaScript**
* Backend processing is handled via `submit.php`

⚠️ **Important:**
